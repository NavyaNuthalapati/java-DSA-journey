# Array Intermediate concept

## LeetCode Problem

## Difficulty Level
To count the consecutive ones and return how many ones are together! 
- First I thought of comparing the values in array like arr[i]==arr[i+1] but when the i value reaches the length-1 size of array the program is out of bound exception! then i again started with another approach
- Second approach i tried is counting the 1's if there are no consescutive ones then again count returns to zero !!

## Insightfull Message
- No need to think intensively and get tensed because at first i thought of using bruteforce but instead of nested loops we can solve with basic logic so try to think in ways like even odd positions or countind values etc to solve in simple way because foundation is very important to reach optimise level at the end
