### Task:-
Q1. Concatenation of Array
Given an integer array nums of length n, you want to create an array ans of length 2n where ans[i] == nums[i] and ans[i + n] == nums[i] for 0 <= i < n (0-indexed).

### Issue faced:-
Printing the same values of the n sized array in 2n sized array, {nums[0],nums[1],nums[2],nums[0],nums[1],nums[2]} if n=3 so writing the statement that adds the value to the new array inside for loop!! 

## Final Outcome By this problem
The logic for this problem can be multiple ways/Approaches but giving optimised is the best one!! but as a beginner it is ok with the starting kinda beginner-thinking way!

### Task:-
Q2. Given an array arr[] containing the prices of items, your task is to calculate the average of all prices, rounded to two decimal places.
Note:  Return the average of all the items as a String.

### Issue faced:-
Converting int to String type and returning string of Avg, where i got learned some method of string that can convert any data type to String i.e String.format()!
One IMPORTANT ONE IS to print exact two decimal values after point i.e 3.00 or 14.00 like that so to get that we need to use double data type instead of int then two print exact two decimals we need "%.2f" to print exact two decimals after point using string method.

## Final outcome is:-
Learned how to convert int/double data type to string!! using string methods.
