# Description
Logic building is about creating clear, step-by-step methods to solve problems using simple rules and principles. It’s the heart of coding, enabling programmers to think, reason, and arrive at smart solutions just like we do.

-Here are some tips for improving your programming logic:
1.Understand the problem: Read and understand the problem statement.
2.Generate Examples: Create additional input and output cases for each problem.
3.Draw observations: Draw observations and patterns based on the examples you created.
4.Start with Basic: First, think of the basic way to solve the problem then optimize the solution.
